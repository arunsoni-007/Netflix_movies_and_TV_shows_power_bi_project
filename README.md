# ðŸ“Š Netflix Dashboard: Built with Power BI ðŸŽ¥

---

Iâ€™ve created an interactive dashboard to analyze Netflix's vast content library. It covers:

---

- Total titles, ratings, and genres.
- Top 10 countries contributing content.
- Release trends of TV shows and movies over the years.
  
## This project highlights my expertise in:

- Cleaning data for accuracy.
- Creating visuals for storytelling.
- Using DAX for advanced calculations.
